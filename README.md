# Quiet path UI (deprecated)

An interactive route planner for finding quieter routes for walking using the [green paths route planner](https://github.com/DigitalGeographyLab/hope-green-path-server) project initiated as part of my master's thesis [(github.com/hellej/quiet-paths-msc)](https://github.com/hellej/quiet-paths-msc). Further development of this project is moved to [github.com/DigitalGeographyLab/hope-green-path-ui](https://github.com/DigitalGeographyLab/hope-green-path-ui) and this repository is deprecated. 


# Green path UI

Live demo: [green-paths.web.app](https://green-paths.web.app/)

A user interface for the [Green Paths](https://github.com/DigitalGeographyLab/hope-green-path-server/) route planner being developed within [UIA HOPE project](https://ilmanlaatu.eu/briefly-in-english/) â€“ Healthy Outdoor Premises for Everyone. Its goal is to help people find routes of fresh air, less noise and more greenery for walking and cycling in the Helsinki capital region.

The route planner utilizes air quality index (AQI) data from the [FMI-ENFUSER](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/environmental-information-fusion-service) modeling system (by the Finnish Meteorological Institute) and modeled [traffic noise data](www.syke.fi/en-US/Open_information/Spatial_datasets/Downloadable_spatial_dataset#E) from the Helsinki capital region. AQI is based on real-time hourly data as a composite measure of NO2, PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and O3. Green view (i.e. greenery) data is derived from [analyzing Google Street View images](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920304959?via%3Dihub) and openly available [land cover data by HRI](https://hri.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/paakaupunkiseudun-maanpeiteaineisto).

Currently implemented features include calculation of unpolluted, green and quiet paths for walking or cycling (separately) with respect to real-time air quality, street level green view index and typical (day-evening-night) noise levels from road and rail traffic. The exposure-based routing method (and application) is based on [an MSc thesis](https://github.com/hellej/quiet-paths-msc).
